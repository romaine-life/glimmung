# Durable Project Configuration

Status: design + staged implementation. Stage 1 shipped (merged, migrated on
prod). Stage 2 (declarative import/sync surface) shipped (merged, live on prod).
Stage 3 (glimmung's own `.glimmung/project.yaml` + CI reconcile) in progress.

Owner surface: `internal/store/pg/projects.go`, `internal/store/store/postgres.go`,
`internal/server/project_write_api.go`, and `internal/server/project_sync_api.go`.

## Problem

Project rows are durable Postgres state, but the only write path is the
imperative `register_project` upsert (`POST /v1/projects` →
`ProjectWriter.UpsertProject` → `pg.ProjectsStore.Upsert`). That upsert does a
**wholesale payload replace**:

```sql
ON CONFLICT (name) DO UPDATE
  SET payload = EXCLUDED.payload, github_repo = EXCLUDED.github_repo
```

and the payload is rebuilt from only `{name, github_repo, metadata}` taken from
the request body. Two structural defects fall out of this:

1. **Authored config has no complete source.** Callers hand-assemble a partial
   `metadata` map. Any field a caller omits is silently destroyed on the next
   register. This is how the live `glimmung` project lost its
   `test_slot_hot_swap` block — a later partial re-register dropped it — which
   forced a manual `kubectl cp` instead of the documented
   `glimmung-agent test-slot-hot-swap` path (`docs/test-slot-hot-swap.md`).

2. **Server-reconciled status is interleaved with authored config.** Reconciler
   outputs (`managed_auth_origin_status`,
   `native_standby_workload_identity_status`) live *inside* the same `metadata`
   blob that a human/agent overwrites on register. So a config write clobbers
   status, and a status write has to read-modify-write the whole authored blob
   (`mutateProject`). The two concerns are tangled and neither is safe to write
   independently.

There is no version history, no drift detection, and no declarative source —
project config is process-memory that any partial write corrupts invisibly.

This violates `docs/quality-timeframes.md` ("prefer durable state over process
memory", "settled contracts over compatibility layers", "the durable data model
is explicit") and leaves a class of silent-corruption bugs live.

## The model already exists for workflows

Glimmung solved the identical problem for **workflows** and codified the stance
in `docs/workflow-inspiration.md`: Postgres registrations remain the runtime
contract. Workflow definitions are registered through the Glimmung control
plane, not imported from project repositories.

Workflows have, and projects lack:

| Concern | Workflows | Projects (today) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Durable runtime row | `workflows (project, name)` | `projects (name)` |
| Immutable version history | `workflow_schemas (project, schema_ref)`, content-hash `schema_ref` | none |
| Transactional versioned write | `WorkflowsStore.Upsert` mints schema + moves pointer | `Upsert` blind replace |
| Config vs status separation | status lives in `runs`, never in the workflow payload | status tangled into `metadata` |
| Import artifact | none; durable registration is the source | none |
| Drift detection | schema/version comparison inside durable state | none |
| Apply route | `POST /v1/workflows` registration | none |

The fix is to bring projects up to the workflow object's durability bar. The
end state: **authored project config is a complete declarative document
(`.glimmung/project.yaml`), versioned immutably, reconciled into Postgres;
server-reconciled status is a separate, reconciler-owned column.** A full
config write then replaces authored config cleanly — exactly like a workflow
registration — without ever touching status.

## Target data model

`projects` table gains:

- `config_schema_ref text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` — pointer to the current
  authored-config version (content hash).
- `status jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` — reconciler-owned. Holds the
  `*_status` blobs that used to live in `payload.metadata`.

New table, mirroring `workflow_schemas`:

```
project_config_schemas (
  name        text NOT NULL,
  schema_ref  text NOT NULL,           -- "pcs_<sha256[:8]>" of canonical authored config
  payload     jsonb NOT NULL,          -- the full authored-config document at this version
  created_at  timestamptz NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (name, schema_ref)
)
```

Authored config = `{name, githubRepo, metadata}` with the server-managed
`*_status` keys removed. The content hash is computed over a canonicalized form
of that document (stable key order), identical in spirit to
`workflowSchemaRef`.

### Config vs status split

Server-managed (reconciler-owned, lives in `status` column, never in an
authored register/file):

- `managed_auth_origin_status` (written by `SetManagedAuthOriginStatus`)
- `native_standby_workload_identity_status` (written by
  `SetNativeWorkloadIdentityStatus`)

Everything else in `metadata` is authored config — including
`native_standby_dns` (count + config), `native_standby_workload_identity`
(config), `test_slot_helm`, `test_slot_hot_swap`, and the per-project TTL
fields. Operator actions that set authored config through dedicated APIs
(`SetTestEnvironmentCount`, `SetTestLeaseDefaultTTL`, …) mutate authored config
and mint a new config version; they never write the `status` column.

### Read compatibility

`projectFromRecord` / `scanProjectRow` merge the `status` column back under
`Metadata` before returning, so the `server.Project` shape and every API
response (and the frontend, which renders `managed_auth_origin_status`) are
**unchanged**. The split is a storage-layer concern; the read contract is
stable. This is a clean migration, not a compatibility shim: nothing reads the
old interleaved layout after the backfill.

## Stages

Each stage leaves the system coherent on its own.

### Stage 1 — Durable substrate (this PR)

1. Migration (idempotent, `IF NOT EXISTS`, non-destructive to the existing row):
   - add `projects.config_schema_ref`, `projects.status`;
   - create `project_config_schemas`;
   - one-time backfill: move `payload.metadata.managed_auth_origin_status` and
     `payload.metadata.native_standby_workload_identity_status` into `status`,
     delete them from `metadata`, and seed `config_schema_ref` +
     `project_config_schemas` from the current authored config.
2. `projectConfigSchemaRef(payload)` content hash.
3. Rework `ProjectsStore.Upsert`: transactional — mint the immutable
   `project_config_schemas` row (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), move the
   `config_schema_ref` pointer, replace authored `payload`, and **leave the
   `status` column untouched**.
4. Reconciler status setters write the `status` column only. Authored-config
   setters (`SetTestEnvironmentCount`, TTL setters, slot-array strip) mutate
   `payload` and re-version.
5. Read merge in `scanProjectRow` so API/Frontend shape is unchanged.
6. Observability: structured log + counter on each config-version transition
   (`project`, prev→new `config_schema_ref`), per `docs/observability.md`.
7. Guard tests: a register that omits status preserves status; a full register
   replaces authored config and mints exactly one new version; re-registering
   identical config is a no-op version (same `schema_ref`).

After Stage 1 a config write can no longer destroy reconciled status, every
config write is recoverable/auditable, and the substrate for declarative sync
exists. It does **not** yet prevent an authored-config field (like
`test_slot_hot_swap`) from being dropped by a partial register — that requires a
complete authored source, which is Stage 2.

### Stage 2 — Declarative project config as import/sync input

1. `.glimmung/project.yaml` in each project's own repo (for glimmung, the
   glimmung repo). The complete authored-config document; the README "dogfood
   metadata" becomes real and checked-in.
2. `GET /v1/projects/{project}/upstream` (drift) and
   `POST /v1/projects/{project}/sync` (apply). Sync replaces authored config
   from the file (safe — status is a separate column) and mints a version.
3. The repo file becomes the reviewable source of truth; Postgres stays the
   runtime contract. A partial register can no longer be the source of authored
   config drift because the file is complete by construction.

Delivered by the glimmung-side surface (this PR):

- `GET /v1/projects/{project}/upstream` (drift) and
  `POST /v1/projects/{project}/sync` (admin-gated apply), in
  `internal/server/project_sync_api.go`.
- `ProjectSyncClient.FetchProjectFile` reads `.glimmung/project.yaml`.
- `parseProjectYAML` runs the same authored-config validators as
  `register_project` (`hotswap.FromMetadata`, `validateTestSlotHelmMetadata`)
  and strips any server-managed status key that leaked into the file.
- `projectsInSync` compares the canonical authored document
  (`{name, github_repo, metadata}` minus status keys) so a reconciler status
  write never registers as authored drift. Sync uses the Stage-1
  `UpsertProject` path, so it versions authored config and never touches the
  `status` column.

Still pending for full parity: the actual `.glimmung/project.yaml` file for
glimmung carrying `test_slot_hot_swap` (Stage 3), and the matching
`*_project` sync/upstream MCP wrappers in tank-operator (cross-repo).

### Stage 3 — Reconcile + restore (this PR)

1. `.glimmung/project.yaml` added to the glimmung repo. It carries the
   **complete** authored config (`native_standby_dns`,
   `native_standby_workload_identity`, `test_slot_helm`) plus the restored
   `test_slot_hot_swap` block (static `frontend/dist →
   /var/run/glimmung-static-override`; backend supervisor `go build … →
   /var/run/glimmung-hot/glimmung`, health `/healthz`). Completeness is
   load-bearing: sync replaces authored config wholesale, so a partial file
   would drop the other fields. A guard test
   (`TestCommittedProjectYAMLParsesAndCarriesHotSwap`) parses the checked-in
   file through the exact register-path validators and asserts every authored
   key — including `test_slot_hot_swap` — is present and no status key is
   authored.
2. `.github/workflows/project-config-reconcile.yaml` reconciles the file into
   the durable row on merge to main (path-filtered on `.glimmung/project.yaml`).
   It mints an admin token for the allowlisted `mcp-glimmung/mcp-glimmung`
   service account (same Azure-OIDC → AKS-admin → `kubectl create token`
   pattern as `test-slot-smoke.yaml`), POSTs `/v1/projects/glimmung/sync`, and
   then asserts `/v1/projects/glimmung/upstream` reports `in_sync` — failing
   the job on any residual drift. The file is the reviewable source of truth;
   Postgres stays the runtime contract; the two cannot silently diverge.

## Cross-repo note

The agent-facing MCP tools for workflow registration live in `mcp-glimmung`.
Workflow file sync tools are retired: workflow shape changes go through durable
Glimmung registration. Project config sync remains separate and applies only to
`.glimmung/project.yaml`.

## Migration safety

`project_config_schemas`, the new columns, and the backfill are additive and
idempotent. The existing `projects` row is never dropped or replaced by the
migration — it is read, split, and rewritten in place under the same advisory
lock the rest of `RunMigrations` uses. No old interleaved-layout read path
survives the backfill (migration-policy compliant).

### Who runs the migration: only the prod control plane

Glimmung test slots run a hot-swappable copy of the binary against the **same
Postgres database** as prod (see `Settings.ControlPlaneLoopsEnabled`). Anything
that mutates that shared schema or data must therefore be owned by exactly one
process — the prod control plane. Before this work, `RunMigrations`, the
slot-storage one-shot, and (newly) `BackfillConfigSchemas` ran unconditionally,
so every slot re-applied migrations against the prod database on boot. That was
harmless only because those migrations were already applied and idempotent; a
slot hot-swapped with a binary carrying an *unshipped* migration would apply it
to prod early — and, while the still-old prod reader was live, prod would lose
visibility of any column the migration moved data into.

So all three startup DB mutators (`RunMigrations`, `BackfillConfigSchemas`, and
the slot-storage `MigrateProjectSlotsIntoCollection`) are gated behind
`ControlPlaneLoopsEnabled`. Prod (loops enabled, the default) owns schema
changes; slots (loops disabled) skip them and serve HTTP against the
prod-owned schema.

A direct consequence: **a new migration cannot be validated in a slot.** A slot
running new code that needs new columns will not have them until prod migrates,
and it no longer applies them itself. New-migration changes are validated by
unit tests + CI and land atomically at prod rollout, where the same process
both migrates and reads the new shape under the advisory lock. This is an
accepted property of the shared-database slot model, not a gap to paper over.
