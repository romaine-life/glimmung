# Workflow Inspiration

This note names the external systems worth reading while the Glimmung workflow
model is settling. It is not an adoption plan. The local contracts in
[`workflow-shape.md`](workflow-shape.md) and
[`run-graph-display-design.md`](run-graph-display-design.md) stay primary:
Glimmung owns issues, runs, phases, jobs, evidence, touchpoints, queueing, and
human decisions.

The useful pattern is to borrow proven primitives without inheriting another
product's boundary. Argo, Tekton, Temporal, Kueue, Nomad, Prow, Buildkite, and
Concourse each solve one part of the problem. None of them describes the whole
Glimmung shape.

## Design Stance

- **Runtime source of truth:** Postgres workflow registrations remain the runtime
  contract. Any workflow import artifact is an admin input, not what dispatch
  reads.
- **Execution layer:** Glimmung-managed phases run as Kubernetes Jobs. Another
  workflow engine can be useful under a phase later, but it should not become
  the user-facing run graph.
- **Graph level:** Phases are the horizontal graph. There is exactly one entry
  phase, and every later phase depends on the immediately previous phase. Jobs
  inside one phase run in parallel and do not depend on each other.
- **Required safety rails:** Every workflow has an entry phase, a verifying
  phase, and a teardown cleanup phase.
- **Human surface:** Touchpoints and run reports explain what a reviewer needs
  to inspect or decide. CI-style logs are inputs to that surface, not the
  surface itself.

## Negative Reference

[GitLab CI `needs`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/yaml/needs/) is useful mostly as
a warning. It proves that job-level DAGs are powerful, but they also make a
pipeline harder to read once every job can point at every other job. Glimmung's
constraint is deliberate: phases express left-to-right ordering; jobs inside a
phase are parallel siblings.

If a job needs another job's output, put it in a later phase. Do not add
job-to-job dependencies inside a phase.

## What This Means For Glimmung

The nearest established path is a composite:

1. Use **Argo/Tekton** as references for Kubernetes execution records.
2. Use **Temporal** as the reference for durable orchestration semantics.
3. Use **Kueue/Nomad** as references for capacity and allocation decisions.
4. Use **Prow/Zuul** as references for review gates and merge readiness.
5. Use **Buildkite/Concourse** as references for job boundaries, hooks,
   artifacts, and annotations.
6. Use **SWE-agent/OpenHands** as references for agent work loops and evidence.
7. Use **GitLab `needs`** as the line Glimmung is intentionally not crossing.

That composite is why Glimmung feels unusual. It is combining known primitives
around a narrower product model: issue-driven agentic development with a
visible verify loop, scarce agent capacity, durable run history, and human
review as a first-class decision.

## Review Checklist

When a workflow change claims to follow the established path, check it against
these questions:

- Does the registered workflow remain the runtime source of truth?
- Does the visible graph still use phase -> job -> step vocabulary?
- Does the phase chain still have exactly one entry and one previous phase per
  later phase?
- Are jobs within a phase still strictly parallel?
- Is verification explicit and self-enforcing or gated by a Glimmung-owned
  gate?
- Does cleanup run on every terminal outcome without running review touchpoints
  after aborts?
- Are capacity decisions modeled as Glimmung queue/lease decisions?
- Does evidence flow into run reports and touchpoints instead of disappearing
  into executor-native logs?
- Does the change avoid making GitHub Actions, Argo, Tekton, or another system
  the canonical owner of run identity?
