# Reviews, RunReports, And Playbook Integration

This document fixes the object boundaries for review surfaces and execution
telemetry. Older `Report` terminology is migration debt; new design and API
work should use these boundaries and delete old surfaces when migrating them.

## RunReport

A RunReport is the factual audit lens for exactly one Run.

It answers: what happened in this execution?

V1 cardinality:

```text
Run -> RunReport
```

Each RunReport is strictly scoped to one Run. Do not introduce a RunReport
grouping object for v1. Cross-run totals can be derived by Review or
Playbook views when needed.

The materialized API is:

```text
GET /v1/projects/{project}/issues/{issue_number}/runs/{run_number}/report
```

It is derived from the Run document and includes attempt summaries,
cumulative cost, validation URL, typed evidence, screenshot markdown kept only
as migrated display content, abort reason, reviewer attribution (who approved,
rejected, or cancelled the review gate, and when), and the terminal
timestamp when present.

A RunReport may eventually include:

- wall time and phase durations
- total cost and per-phase or per-step cost
- verification result
- WebM videos, screenshots, artifacts, and validation URL
- logs or runner step summaries
- decision outcome
- abort or failure reason

RunReport can be persisted or materialized from Run attempts, runner events,
and artifacts later. The invariant is the one-Run scope.

## Review

A Review is the user-facing decision surface for exactly one Issue.

It answers: what should the user inspect or decide now?

Cardinality:

```text
Issue <-> Review
```

This is a strict one-to-one product invariant, not a pagination or v1
implementation detail. An Issue never has multiple Reviews, and a
Review should not be addressed as an independent child collection of an
Issue. If work is recycled or rerun, the same Review updates to
reflect the current decision surface.

The Review is a live summary and navigation page for the Issue's current
decision state. It is not the historical log and it is not the place to
persist per-Run records. It updates as new Runs happen. Anything that is
specific to one Run belongs in the Run and RunReport UI. History lives under
Runs and RunReports.

A merged Review closes its Issue. In the normal isolated-PR case, merge is
the acceptance event for the work represented by that Issue; after the
Review reaches `merged`, the linked Issue should transition to `closed`.
Follow-on orchestration that needs different integration behavior should model
that explicitly through Playbook integration strategy or dependencies rather
than leaving the Issue open after its Review has merged.

A Review may eventually expose an audit/debug history of changes to the
live surface itself. That history is acceptable only as history of one
Review being updated; it must not imply that an Issue has multiple
Review instances.

Potential generic actions:

- approve, merge, or submit
- request changes
- enter attended mode
- rerun or request a second unattended pass

V1 actions should stay generic rather than workflow-defined. Request changes
should requeue work, not merely annotate the Review.

## UI Responsibility

The Review should behave like a compact checklist/dashboard and navigation
hub for the current Issue decision. It may show:

- validation URL
- WebM videos
- screenshots
- changed files or PR-equivalent link
- generated artifacts
- portfolio elements or UI checks when available
- run summary and recommendation

The Issue tab remains the primary prose/context surface. Epic and Playbook
context belongs mostly there. The Review should focus on the current exact
evidence, links into the relevant Run UI, and the decision in front of the
user. If evidence or state needs to be retained per Run, model and render it
from the Run or RunReport instead of adding Review history.

The Review UI should not feel like a record detail page or a ledger. Avoid
showing Run counts, attempt tables, historical PR lists, or multiple
Review-looking rows in the Review section. Those are valuable
inspection tools, but they belong in the Runs tab, RunReport pages, or a
future debug view. The default Review experience is the current live
frontend for user interaction.

## Terminology Migration

Conceptual rename:

```text
Current Report -> Review
Current ReportVersion -> ReviewVersion, if versions remain useful
New RunReport -> per-Run factual execution report
```

Live API and frontend surfaces use Review and RunReport terminology.
Postgres `reviews` is the physical Review storage table; do not add
Report-named routes, UI controls, runtime reads, aliases, or tests for
terminology cleanup.

## Playbooks And Reviews

A Playbook is an execution sequencer, not primarily a human approval workflow.

Two useful execution modes:

```text
automatic sequence
  run entry 1
  if successful, run entry 2
  if successful, run entry 3
  stop on failure, explicit gate, budget, or conflict

bulk queue
  enqueue all eligible entries
  dependency and concurrency rules control execution
```

Automatic Playbook entries should not create full normal Reviews by
default. Telemetry still exists through Runs and RunReports, but review
surfaces should not pile up when no human is expected to review each entry.

Automatic entries may have a minimal connective page when useful:

- "This entry is part of an automatic Playbook execution."
- link to the overall Playbook
- link to the current Run or next execution

Create a full Review at human decision boundaries, such as final review of
a shared feature branch, failure triage, or attended intervention.

## Issue Dependencies

Dependency/readiness is separate from Playbook membership.

A future issue dependency primitive can let bulk queues and Playbooks share the
same readiness rule:

```text
IssueDependency
  issue_id
  depends_on_issue_id
  condition: succeeded | review_approved | merged | closed
```

Dependencies answer:

```text
Can this issue start yet?
```

They should not decide branch or environment behavior.

## Integration Strategy

Execution sequencing is separate from integration policy.

Playbook answers:

```text
What work runs, in what order, with what dependencies?
```

Integration policy answers:

```text
Where does each entry land?
```

V1 vocabulary:

- `isolated_prs`
- `shared_feature_branch`
- `rolling_main`

`isolated_prs`: each issue gets its own branch, Review, and merge.
Dependencies only control order. Use for unrelated or loosely related work.

`shared_feature_branch`: all automatic Playbook entries build on one branch or
work context. A final Review reviews the whole feature. Use for one large
feature split into smaller agent tasks.

`rolling_main`: each successful entry merges to `main` before the next entry
starts. Use for bootstrap, app, and infra flows where later work depends on
real integrated resources, Argo health, Tofu apply, or cloud-provider state.
This strategy must be explicit and planner-selected.

The typed field is `integration_strategy` on `PlaybookCreate` and `Playbook`.
It defaults to `isolated_prs`; `rolling_main` playbooks must be serial
(`concurrency_limit` unset or `1`).

When a Playbook entry is started, Glimmung derives a work context and stamps it
onto both the generated Issue metadata and the dispatch metadata:

- `isolated_prs`: one branch context per entry,
  `glimmung/playbooks/<playbook>/<entry>`
- `shared_feature_branch`: one branch context for the whole Playbook,
  `glimmung/playbooks/<playbook>`
- `rolling_main`: serial context targeting the base ref, currently `main`

This gives runners a concrete `work_context_branch` and
`work_context_base_ref` without letting individual issue specs invent their own
branch policy.

## Work Context

Branch and environment handoff should come from the Playbook integration
strategy, not from individual issue dependencies by default.

Potential future object:

```text
WorkContext
  branch
  base_ref
  owner_issue_id or playbook_id
  current_run_id
  state: available | in_use | finalized
```

For automatic Playbooks, leaving a branch up is not necessarily an error. It
may be the artifact passed to the next entry. The existing Lock primitive likely
applies to marking a branch or work context as in use by a running issue.

## Design Principles

- Do not make one agent session do a whole feature.
- Break large work into discoverable, queueable segments.
- Preserve branch and main guardrails while supporting fast iteration.
- Keep RunReport one-to-one with Run for v1.
- Keep Review strictly one-to-one with Issue.
- Put cross-run summaries in the Review or dashboard as derived data.
- Make dangerous integration behavior like rolling merges explicit.
