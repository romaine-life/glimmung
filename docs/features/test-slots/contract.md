# Test Slots Contract

This contract applies to runner test-slot capacity, slot provisioning,
checkout, activation, return, lease TTL, slot-local Playwright, and test-slot
hot swap.

## Product Model

Test slots are prepared capacity for validating agent work without waiting for
full rollout. A slot is not running user workload until Glimmung assigns a
lease. The system must make the difference between provisioned, leased,
running, cleaning, and available explicit.

## Sources Of Truth

- Postgres `slots` owns per-slot lifecycle state.
- Postgres `slot_history` owns slot audit history.
- Postgres `projects` owns slot configuration only, such as count, DNS, Helm,
  workload identity, and hot-swap metadata.
- Postgres `leases` owns active capacity claims and lease TTL.
- Kubernetes owns actual preliminary and lease-scoped resources.
- `docs/test-slot-lifecycle.md` owns slot terms and lifecycle behavior.
- `docs/test-slot-hot-swap.md` owns hot-swap metadata shape and apply behavior.
- `Settings.ControlPlaneLoopsEnabled` (env `CONTROL_PLANE_LOOPS_ENABLED`,
  enforced in `cmd/glimmung-go/main.go`) owns the boundary between processes
  that join the control plane and processes that only serve HTTP handlers.
  The prod glimmung Deployment leaves it at the default `true`; every
  per-issue release rendered by `k8s/issue/` (hot and warm) sets it to
  `false`.

## Migration Rules

- Do not store slot lifecycle state in project metadata.
- Do not treat warmed/provisioned capacity as running application workload.
- Do not let callers choose a slot for checkout; Glimmung chooses.
- Do not expose destructive cleanup controls through the MCP checkout surface.
- Do not keep manual `kubectl cp` plus `kill -HUP` as the documented hot-swap
  path after the apply endpoint supports the project.
- Do not add app/proxy/session/browser pods to unleased preliminary capacity.
- Do not start a background reconciler, recovery sweep, or other goroutine
  that mutates shared runtime state (Postgres rows owned by the run/signal
  loop, `glimmung-runs` Kubernetes Jobs, prod-namespace Secrets) outside the
  `settings.ControlPlaneLoopsEnabled` gate in `cmd/glimmung-go/main.go`. Slot
  processes serve HTTP handlers against the same Postgres and the same
  apiserver as prod; running the control plane in a slot races prod for the
  same rows and Jobs. Add new reconcilers to the gated `switch`, not next to
  it.

## Live Behavior

- Queue-size changes seed or delete slot docs and fire per-slot provisioning
  work without blocking on runtime activation. For projects with
  `metadata.test_slot_helm.enabled=true`, provisioning includes the warm Helm
  pass only.
- Admin repair revalidates one configured, unleased slot by rerunning
  preliminary reconciliation and the warm Helm pass only; it must reject active
  leases and runtime cleanup states.
- Checkout records a lease before activation and returns either ready runtime
  state or an explicit asynchronous activating state.
- Checkout admission, `/v1/state`, the dashboard, and MCP lease discovery must
  use the same durable slot-row projection. Operator-visible availability must
  not be capped or contradicted by process-local manifest configuration.
- Activation materializes lease-scoped runtime and waits for required runtime
  readiness before `usable=true`.
- Return and callback release tear down lease-scoped runtime before capacity is
  available again.
- TTL updates and extensions update durable lease state and re-arm timers from
  the durable deadline.
- When the originating Issue has `preserve_test_env=true`, the workflow's
  early cleanup phase reports conclusion `skipped` instead of executing.
  The lease stays alive through the human review gate so the reviewer can
  poke at the live build, and the final cleanup phase tears it down after
  approve, reject, or abort releases the gate.
- Image deploy resolves the verified `git_ref` to its commit SHA, looks up the
  commit-addressed `sha-<commit>` image alias that `docker-build-check` publishes
  (a pointer at the content-fingerprinted manifest), deploys it into the selected
  leased slot, records history on every outcome, and extends short leases to the
  configured minimum remaining TTL. Resolution is a direct registry lookup by the
  verified commit SHA — there is no GitHub Actions run/PR/attempt reconstruction
  and no `ci-pr`/`ci-ref` lookup tag.
- A slot process (the binary running inside any `k8s/issue/` release, hot or
  warm) starts the HTTP server, applies database migrations a hot-swap may
  need to land, and serves request-driven code paths. It does not start the
  signal-drain, run-queue, dispatch-timeout, or test-slot recovery
  reconcilers; those run only in the prod glimmung Deployment.
- Lease cleanup is the single retention boundary for free
  (lease-scoped) inspections produced by `POST /v1/inspections`. The
  cleanup goroutine deletes every matching `slot_inspections` row and the
  underlying `report.json` + `screenshot.png` blobs. See
  [Observability And Evidence capabilities → durable-inspections](../observability-and-evidence/capabilities.md).

## Failure And Recovery

- Process start resumes in-flight provisioning, activation, cleaning, and TTL
  timers from durable state.
- Process start also expires every lease whose durable `expires_at` deadline
  has passed but whose state is still `active` or `claimed` (orphaned
  callback releases, AfterFunc timers killed with the previous process,
  pre-test-slot-lifecycle lease shapes). The sweep is gated by
  `Settings.ControlPlaneLoopsEnabled` so slot processes never run it. After
  terminalizing such a lease, the sweep also releases any runner slot
  reservation the lease still pinned (`runner_k8s` and not a test-slot
  checkout): terminalizing the lease row alone leaves the slot's
  `active_lease_ref` set, stranding the slot in `provisioned` outside the
  available pool forever. Reservation release is best-effort and logged; a
  failure leaves the lease correctly expired and the slot recoverable via
  admin repair. See `server.ExpireStaleLeases`.
- Admin repair may retry preliminary-resource errors, but cleanup-error slots
  remain on the runtime cleanup path. Repair refuses any slot a live
  (`claimed`/`active`) lease still holds — checkout lease or runner run lease
  alike — but a slot whose `active_lease_ref` points only at a terminal
  (`released`/`expired`) lease is an orphaned reservation: repair clears the
  stale ref as it walks the slot back to `provisioned`, returning the slot to
  the available pool.
- An `error`+`cleanup_error` slot orphaned with no live lease is recoverable at
  runtime via `returnTestSlot` addressed by `slot_name`/`slot_index`: it
  synthesizes a warmup lease, claims `error→cleaning`, and re-drives cleanup
  with `releaseLease=false`. This is the request-time counterpart of the
  startup recovery sweep's orphan arm, so a transient cleanup-dependency outage
  (e.g. the auth token exchange briefly unreachable) does not strand the slot
  until a process restart. It adds no background reconciler or sweep — only a
  request handler. Ineligible slots (unknown, healthy, stale `cleaning`, or
  activation-only `error`) keep the existing `404`.
- Activation failure records error state and releases or cleans up the lease
  through the lifecycle path.
- Cleanup failure leaves the slot unavailable with visible error state rather
  than handing out dirty runtime.
- Hot-swap build, copy, timeout, and health failures are recorded in lease
  metadata or history.
- Slot-local Playwright absence is treated as unsupported cluster capability,
  not as permission to fall back to an unrelated browser host.
- Image-deploy resolution distinguishes a CI image that is *not built yet* from
  one that *cannot exist*. The `sha-<commit>` alias is looked up directly; if it
  is absent, the commit's `docker-build-check` run is read to explain why. A
  queued/in-progress build returns `409` with a retryable "image not ready"
  message so the caller's settle-wait re-polls; a failed build, a build that
  succeeded without publishing the alias, or a commit no build targets returns
  `422`. The resolver never fabricates a run-scoped tag for a commit whose build
  did not publish it (the 2026-06-20 deploy-image race).

## Observability

- Slot state, active lease ref, activation state, cleanup state, error fields,
  and Playwright endpoint should be visible in `/v1/state`.
- Hot-swap history should include operation, status, summary, diagnostics, and
  timings.
- Provisioning, activation, cleanup, TTL expiry, and hot-swap failures should
  be identifiable by project, slot, lease, and source event.

## Acceptance Checks

- Slot lifecycle changes include tests for the durable state transition being
  changed.
- MCP checkout or lease extension changes update `mcp-glimmung` tool signature,
  docstring, and payload tests in the same rollout.
- Hot-swap contract changes update validation tests and the live project
  metadata shape when needed.
- Helm/chart changes run `helm template` or equivalent rendering evidence.
- Changes prove that unleased provisioned slots do not run long-lived runtime
  workload.
- A new background reconciler or recovery sweep adds a test that proves the
  Start… function is unreachable when `Settings.ControlPlaneLoopsEnabled` is
  false (either the gate in `cmd/glimmung-go/main.go` skips the call, or the
  Start… function itself returns early). See
  [Test Slots capabilities → slot-control-plane-isolation](capabilities.md).
