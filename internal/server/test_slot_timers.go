// testSlotLeaseTimers holds one *time.Timer per claimed test-slot lease that
// has a TTL. The timer fires once at the deadline and kicks off the same
// cleanup pathway that POST /v1/test-slots/return uses. Release/cancel paths
// Stop the timer first so it never fires after the lease is gone.
//
// Storage is in-process and not durable. On glimmung restart the map is
// empty; recovery is the responsibility of RecoverInFlightTestSlots, which
// walks durable lease state once at startup and re-arms a timer for every
// still-claimed test-slot lease (computing remaining TTL from AssignedAt).
//
// This design replaces the 15-second polling reconciler that previously
// detected expired leases. The "event" the cleanup pathway responds to is the
// deadline arriving, not a tick noticing the deadline has already passed.

// (handles re-arming on process restart through the recovery sweep). A
// deadline already in the past fires on the next scheduler tick.
//
// Call only for `claimed` test-slot leases with TTLSeconds > 0.
