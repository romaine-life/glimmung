// deadline has passed but whose state is still active or claimed to

// sweep runs once during glimmung process start and only when
// Settings.ControlPlaneLoopsEnabled is true; slot processes intentionally
// do not run it.
//
// Source of orphans the sweep recovers:
//
//   - runner-k8s active leases never released because the run completion
//     callback never arrived (404 token, malformed payload, pod evicted
//     mid-callback). The active state has no in-process timer; only this
//     sweep moves it terminal.
//   - claimed test-slot checkout leases whose AfterFunc deadline fired
//     while glimmung was down and whose lease metadata lacks the
//     test_slot_checkout=true flag that RecoverInFlightTestSlots filters
//     on (older lease shapes). Recover silently skips them so the timer
//     is never re-armed.
//   - Lease rows from pre-test-slot-lifecycle code that no live cleanup
//     path covers.
//
// At-startup execution is sufficient because every fresh active/claimed
// lease arms its own in-process release or AfterFunc timer in the same
// process that created it. Only orphans from a previous process survive
// across a restart, and the sweep catches them on the way back up.
//
// The mutate closure inside PatchLeasePayload re-checks state inside the
// SELECT FOR UPDATE transaction so a concurrent release/cancel/callback
// path that wins the race is not overwritten by the sweep.
